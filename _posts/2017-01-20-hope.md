If you had told me eight years ago how much the person I was voting for would directly impact my life, I would have told you were crazy. I can remember quite clearly, walking to our polling place - an elementary school now closed, with our first child in tow.

I was filled with optimism. It was not the prettiest of campaigns to be sure, but it did have high points filled with soaring rhetoric and real humanity that shone through the drudgery of American campaign politics. We had hope, change, a potential first family that would look like no other that came before. We also had an economic crisis, and for us personally, a house that was going further and further underwater every month, with no relief in sight.

His presidency brought political fights and gridlock, but also incredible change. Economic calamity eventually slowed, stabilized, and was later replaced with a long slow road back to recovery. Uneven, leaving some out to be sure, but real. We cheered as the Affordable Care Act finally became law, and later took advantage of HARP II - a program that brought us welcome relief to our monthly mortgage payment.

A coworker informed me about new program the White House CIO and CTO, Steve VanRoekel and Todd Park respectively, were starting up - something they called the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. I watched their [pitch from Tech Crunch Disrupt](https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/the-21st-century-gold-rush-announced-at-disrupt-raw-data/). I was intrigued, and applied, never thinking anything at all would come of my application. Somehow, I made it through a large applicant pool, to join 17 other fellows in DC. I was terrified. Clearly these were people much smarter than me. I resolved to keep my head down, get work done, and hopefully make it through without anyone noticing. We were incredibly naive and bright eyed. We had an unshakeable belief that our work would make it through the labyrinthine federal bureaucracy before our six month tenure was over. In some cases, our work made real impact. In my case, a public beta was as far as we could move the ball. What we were able to do was set a precedent for the programs that would later follow - 18F and later, USDS, as well as fellows that would stay on and make incredible impact at other federal agencies for years to come. Their impact has made real lasting change, and that to me is the legacy of our little six month jaunt.

Now, in my current role as Creative Director at Ad Hoc, I'm still working on this stuff - improving parts of Healthcare.gov for millions of Americans, and helping to design Vets.gov - a site that is already helping thousands of Veterans get access to the services they so richly deserve.

As someone who's personal politics lean left, and who has had the incredible opportunity to see our executive branch up close, I certainly have concerns about what comes next. The next few months will be painful, as many of President Obama's executive orders will be undone, and perhaps the ACA itself. But what I can't shake, what I don't think can be removed, is the incredible precedent he set for all of us. His unshakable optimism about who American's are at their core - in spite of everything thrown at him - is awe inspiring. The unshakable belief that it is by *we*, not *I*, that real change is made, is something that I will never forget. I'm hopeful the same is true for millions of other Americans that were personally changed by his presidency as well.

Precedents serve to inform future actions - to set a baseline by which we conduct ourselves when confronted with similar circumstances. The precedent this President set cannot be undone by legal action, or by a tweet. Too much has changed, too many ways have we moved forward as a nation, and too many people have been touched.

For me personally, it's fitting that his presidency has been bookended by the birth of our children. Our most recent addition was born this past year - our daughter Hope. Her name is a nod to the motto of our home state of Rhode Island and to President Obama's most enduring theme.

My prayer is that someday, I'll be able to put words to Barack Obama's legacy that she'll understand, and that her generation will continue his work and move us forward once more. Thanks Obama.
